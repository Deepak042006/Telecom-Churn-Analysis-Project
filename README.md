# Telecom-Churn-Analysis-Project
The rapid growth of data and analytics capabilities has revolutionized industries by enabling 
more effective decision-making and strategy development. This analysis focuses on Telco 
Customer Churn Prediction, aiming to identify the likelihood of customer attrition in the 
telecom industry. 
Churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's services, often 
leading to revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs. Predicting churn is critical 
for retaining customers and maintaining profitability.
Various factors influence customer churn, including contract type, monthly charges, tenure, 
payment method, and internet service. Among these, tenure and contract type have been 
identified as significant predictors of customer churn. 
A dataset provided by IBM Watson Analytics, consisting of 21 attributes and 7,043 
instances, has been utilized. The predictive model is developed in the R Environment using 
multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector 
Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbour. 
These models were trained and tested using the Telco dataset to evaluate their predictive 
performance. Model development involved the glm() function for Logistic Regression, and 
additional libraries for SVM,KNN and Random Forest in R Studio. The models were 
evaluated using test data, and results showed accurate churn prediction with minimal error 
rates, highlighting the effectiveness of these approaches in addressing customer churn
